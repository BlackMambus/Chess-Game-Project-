Chess is a timeless board game that blends tactical brilliance with psychological grit. Played between two opponents on an 8x8 checkered board, the goal is simple yet profound: checkmate your opponentâ€™s king while protecting your own. What begins as a quiet opening can erupt into bold sacrifices, intricate combinations, and heart-pounding endgames.

ðŸ§  What Makes Chess Unique
Two armies, one battlefield: Each player commands 16 piecesâ€”pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, a queen, and the all-important king.

Each piece moves differently, creating layers of strategic depth and planning.

The game progresses through three main phases:

Opening: Setup and control of key positions.

Middlegame: Tactical skirmishes and complex planning.

Endgame: Fewer pieces, higher tension, and precise calculation.
